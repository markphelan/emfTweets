# emfTweets

Provides an information display of tweets mentioning "emfcamp" on a screen, as well as printing the tweets via a receipt printer.

This was put together in a hurry and is far from perfect! Known limitations:
- Really only designed to run at 1680x1050 in portrait orientation
- It can't handle running out of paper
- It should print the "first/newest" tweet, not the "last" in the on-screen list
